Assembling the system
# AIM:
To assemble the system
# MATERIALS REQUIRED:
Processor, Motherboard, Power supply, cables, Internal cards
# PROCEDURE:
## Step 1: Mount the Processor
The first step for assembling the computer system starts with mounting the 
processor on the processor socket of the motherboard. To mount the process, you 
don't need to apply any force. The special ZIF (zero insertion force) sockets are 
usually used to prevent any damage to the processor pins. Once the processor is 
mounted, the heat sink will be attached on top of the processor. The CPU fan is also 
attached on top of the heat sink.

## Step 2: Fix the Motherboard in the Tower Case
Now the motherboard is to be fixed vertically in the tower case and the screws are 
fixed from behind of the motherboard.

## Step 3: Connect the Power Supply
Now line up the power supply at the top back end of the cabinet and screw it. The 
power connectors for motherboard power supply and CPU fan power supply are to 
be connected. If the cabinet cooling FAN is required then it is to be screwed at the 
back end grill of the cabinet and its power connector is to be connected from SMPS.

## Step 4: Install the Drives

Install the CD/DVD drives at the top front end of the cabinet and screw it. Install the 
Hard disk drive and floppy disk drive below CD/DVD drive and screw it. Make sure 
once screwed there is no vibration in either of the CD/DVD, hard disk or floppy disk 
drives.

## Step 5: Connect Cables
Now select the appropriate data cable and connect one end of the cable to its drive 
socket and another end at its appropriate connector on the motherboard. For SATA 
hard disk drive or CD/DVD drives use SATA cable and its power cable, else use IDE 
data cable. Do the proper jumper settings as per the usage requirement.

## Step 6: Mount the Memory Modules

It is time now to mount the memory modules on the motherboard by aligning the 
RAM to its socket on the motherboard and press it downward. Make sure the side 
tab are fixed into the RAM notch. If not, you may still have to press a bit.

## Step 7: Install the Internal Cards

Install the internal cards to its socket and attach the cables or power cable to it. The 
selection of right socket or slot is required as per the type of socket.

## Step 8: Cover the Tower

Cover the tower by placing it and pressing towards front side and screw it.

## Step 9: Connect the External Devices and Power

Connect the external devices with CPU at its appropriate socket. It includes mouse 
and keyboard at PS2 or USB connectors. Monitor at the video output socket. 
Connect the power cable to the back of tower in SMPS. Plug in the power cable to 
the electric board.

RESULT:
Hence, the system is successfuly set up.
